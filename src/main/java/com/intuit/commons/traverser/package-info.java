/**
 * Generic traverser helps to perform BFS/DFS traversals
 * on a data structure of any complexity (tree, graph etc).
 *
 * Supports:
 * - both depth- and breadth- first search (DFS/BFS)
 * - manipulating traversal flow (skip, quit)
 * - iterators
 * - local / global context
 * - builders
 * - type safety
