The overall goal of traverser is to implement support for specific set of use cases in a production ready way.

In order to achieve that we have a strong focus on maintainability and high test coverage:

- We expect new or modified unit test for every change (written in [Spock](http://spockframework.org/)) and jUnit.

- Low dependencies footprint is a must.

- traverser is dedicated to specific use cases - expect that some suggestions will be out of scope


For bug reports or specific code related topics create a new issue.

Thanks!
